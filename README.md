Biligrab + Biliup
========

Yet another automatic/semi-automatic/manual danmaku and video file downloader of Bilibili.

This grabber is integrated with most of the "black techs". Good to bypass some copyright and
geolocation restrictions:

* 7 independent ways to parse source(s)! Now with BilibiliPr and you-get! And fake IP!
* Auto concatenates and converts to MP4 (or FLV, even nothing, if not possible) file(s) via direct integration with [Mukioplayer-Py-Mac](https://github.com/cnbeining/Mukioplayer-Py-Mac) (the Flash danmaku playing solution) and [ABPlayer-HTML5-Mac](https://github.com/cnbeining/ABPlayerHTML5-Py--nix) (the HTML5 playing solution, preferred). 
* Interactive and command line mode for different use-cases. And also silent mode.
* Process single or multiple videos with ease. Now you can use Bilibili *mylist*s.
* Convert danmaku to ASS subtitles with ease using m13253's [Danmaku2ass](https://github.com/m13253/danmaku2ass) (GPLv2).
  Both py2 and master (py3) branches available for better danmaku handling.
* Damaku-only exports
* M3U exports -- play danmaku without waiting with players like MPlayer, MPC or VLC, etc. 
* Built-in multi-part download, useful to reduce slow overheads.

Biliup
------

The Bibliotheca Anonoma has added an additional script to download and upload a Bilibili video using the link.

```
biliup.py - Download a Bilibili video with comments, then upload to the Internet Archive.
If the video has more than 1 part, you can specify them manually to download.
If the download doesn't work at first, set a different source for BiliDan to use (1 is preferred outside China):
0 - API, 1 - CDN Overseas, 2 - Origin Source , 3 - Exper. HTML5, 4 - Flvcd (for Youku), 5 - BilibiliPr, 6 - You-get

Usage:
  biliup.py <url>
  biliup.py <url> [--source <src>]
  biliup.py <url> [--source <src>] [--part <p>]...
  biliup.py -h | --help

Arguments:
  <url>           The Bilibili URL to download, in this format: http://www.bilibili.com/video/av314/

Options:
  -h --help       Show this screen.
  --source <src>  Video Source to download from [default: 0].
  --part <p>      Video part to download [default: 0]
```

Example:

> All of these will upload to http://archive.org/details/bilibili-av<vid> :

```
# Download a video with Experimental HTML5 source
python3 biliup.py http://www.bilibili.com/video/av1326828/ --source 3

# Download a video with 3 parts (bilidan is supposed to do this automatically but it doesn't, so you'll have to do it manually)
python3 biliup.py http://www.bilibili.com/video/av1730836/ --part 1 --part 2 --part 3
```

Usage
-----

If you have a Bilibili account, setting the cookie with [dantmnf/biliupload/getcookie.py](https://github.com/dantmnf/biliupload/blob/master/getcookie.py) will help you to download some of the restricted videos. You can do this by hand too.

The file should look like:

    DedeUserID=123456;DedeUserID__ckMd5=****************;SESSDATA=*******************

Interactive mode (Note some functionalities are not available in this mode):

    $ python2 biligrab.py

Or command line mode:

    $ python2 biligrab.py -h
    python biligrab.py (-h) (-a) (-p) (-s) (-c) (-d) (-v) (-l) (-e) (-b) (-m) (-n) (-u) (-t) (-q) (-r) (-g)
    
    -h: Default: None
        Print this usage file.
        
    -a: Default: None
        The av number.
        If not set, Biligrab will use the fallback interactive mode.
        Support "~", "," and mix use.
        Examples:
            Input        Output
              1           [1]
             1,2         [1, 2]
             1~3        [1, 2, 3]
            1,2~3       [1, 2, 3]
            
    -p: Default: 0
        The part number.
        Able to use the same syntax as "-a".
        If set to 0, Biligrab will download all the available parts in the video.
        
    -s: Default: 0
    Source to download.
    0: The original API source, can be Letv backup,
       and can fail if the original video is not available(e.g., deleted)
    1: The CDN API source, "oversea accelerate".
       Can be MINICDN backup in Mainland China or oversea.
       Good to bypass some bangumi's restrictions.
    2: Force to use the original source.
       Use Flvcd to parse the video, but would fail if
       1) The original source DNE, e.g., some old videos
       2) The original source is Letvcloud itself.
       3) Other unknown reason(s) that stops Flvcd from parsing the video.
    For any video that failed to parse, Biligrab will try to use Flvcd.
    (Mainly for oversea users regarding to copyright-restricted bangumies.)
    If the API is blocked, Biligrab would fake the UA.
    3: (Not stable) Use the HTML5 API.
       This works for downloading some cached Letvcloud videos, but is slow, and would fail for no reason sometimes.
       Will retry if unavailable.
    4: Use Flvcd.
       Good to fight with oversea and copyright restriction, but not working with iQiyi.
       May retrieve better quality video, especially for Youku.
    5: Use BilibiliPr.
       Good to fight with some copyright restriction that BilibiliPr can fix.
       Not always working though.
    6: Use You-get (https://github.com/soimort/you-get).
       You need a you-get callable directly like "you-get -u blahblah".
       
    -c: Default: ./bilicookies
    The path of cookies.
    Use cookies to visit member-only videos.
    
    -d: Default: None
    Set the desired download software.
    Biligrab supports aria2c(16 threads), axel(20 threads), wget and curl by far.
    If not set, Biligrab will detect an available one;
    If none of those is available, Biligrab will quit.
    For more software support, please open an issue at https://github.com/cnbeining/Biligrab/issues/
    
    -v: Default:None
    Set the desired concatenate software.
    Biligrab supports ffmpeg by far.
    If not set, Biligrab will detect an available one;
    If none of those is available, Biligrab will quit.
    For more software support, please open an issue at https://github.com/cnbeining/Biligrab/issues/
    Make sure you include a *working* command line example of this software!
    
    -l: Default: INFO
    Dump the log of the output for better debugging.
    Can be set to debug.
    
    -e: Default: 1
    Export Danmaku to ASS file.
    Fulfilled with danmaku2ass(https://github.com/m13253/danmaku2ass/tree/py2),
    Author: @m13253, GPLv3 License.
    *For issue with this function, if you think the problem lies on the danmaku2ass side,
    please open the issue at both projects.*
    If set to 1 or 2, Biligrab will use Danmaku2ass's py2 branch.
    If set to 3, Biligrab will use Danmaku2ass's master branch, which would require
    a python3 callable via 'python3'.
    If python3 not callable or danmaku2ass2/3 DNE, Biligrab will ask for action.
    
    -b: Default: None
    Set the probe software.
    Biligrab supports Mediainfo and FFprobe.
    If not set, Biligrab will detect an available one;
    If none of those is available, Biligrab will quit.
    For more software support, please open an issue at https://github.com/cnbeining/Biligrab/issues/
    Make sure you include a *working* command line example of this software!
    
    -m: Default: 0
    Only download the danmaku.
    
    -n: Default: 0
    Silent Mode.
    Biligrab will not ask any question.
    
    -u: Default: 0
    Export video link to .m3u file, which can be used with MPlayer, mpc, VLC, etc.
    Biligrab will export a m3u8 instead of downloading any video(s).
    Can be broken with sources other than 0 or 1.
    
    -t: Default: None
    The number of Mylist.
    Biligrab will process all the videos in this list.
    
    -q: Default: 3
    The thread number for downloading.
    Good to fix overhead problem.
    
    -r: Default: -1
    Select video quality.
    Only works with Source 0 or 1.
    Range: 0~4, higher for better quality.
    
    -g: Default: 6
    Threads for downloading every part.
    Works with aria2 and axel.
    
    -i: Default: None
    Fake IP address.
